# Introduction
For the first week of our OOP final project, our group officially began the development of DataMedic, a Python-based data cleaning library designed to assist students, beginners in data science, data scientists and analysts in diagnosing and treating common dataset issues. The library aims to embody key object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, composition, and the use of dunder methods. DataMedic will serve as a diagnostic and treatment tool that inspects, cleans, and reports on dataset health—offering a unique, medical-inspired approach to data quality management.
